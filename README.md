- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this repo contains a notebook file for a personal project I did analysing fandango's movie rating system.
- The goal was to see whether fandango changed their ratings display system between 2015 & 2016 following Hickey's expose that fandango shows inflated ratings on it's website.
- Rest of the details can be found in the actual notebook.
